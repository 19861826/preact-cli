	Scratch template for HtmlWebpackPlugin. It expects the template to
	exist on disk and doesn't support in-memory templates. There are some
	workarounds via inline-loader but that would require a scratch file too.
	For now the easiest solution is to just keep this file around and use it
	as a temporary template.
